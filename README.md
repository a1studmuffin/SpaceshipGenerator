# Spaceship Generator

A Blender script to procedurally generate 3D spaceships from a random seed.

Usage
-----
* Install Blender: http://blender.org/download/
* Open a *Text Editor* view
* Press *Alt + O*, or go to *Text > Open Text Block* and open `spaceship_generator.py`
* Press *Alt + P* or click *Run script*

* Start with a box.
* Build the hull: Extrude the front/rear faces several times, adding random translation/scaling/rotation along the way.
* Add asymmetry to the hull: Pick random faces and extrude them out in a similar manner, reducing in scale each time.
* Add detail to the hull: Categorize each face by its orientation and generate details on it such as engines, antenna, weapon turrets, lights etc.
* Sometimes apply horizontal symmetry.
* Add a Bevel modifier to angularize the shape a bit.
* Apply materials to the final result.
* Take over the universe with your new infinite fleet of spaceships.

Extreme examples
----------------
The following screenshots were created using extreme values for the number of hull segments and asymmetry segments to show how the algorithm works.

Tips and Tricks
---------------
* By default the script will delete all objects starting with `Spaceship` before generating a new spaceship. To disable this feature, remove or comment out the call to `reset_scene()` around line 735 in the main function.
* You can provide a seed to the `generate_spaceship()` function to always generate the same spaceship. For example, `generate_spaceship('michael')`.
* The `generate_spaceship()` function takes many more parameters that affect the generation process. Try playing with them!
